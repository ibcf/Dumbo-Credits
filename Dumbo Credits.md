```Dumbo (1941) Art/Animation Credits

(compiled by ibcf)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notes & Caveats

- This is an attempt to provide a more complete understanding of the various artists' roles on Dumbo, mostly based on information found in the animator drafts posted by Hans Perk (http://afilmla.blogspot.com/search/label/Dumbo)

- The information listed here is by no means guaranteed to be accurate; the draft itself was a WIP and potentially subject to change

- The animation categories were expanded and rearranged from the generic "Animation" credit in the film in order to give a better idea of who exactly animated what; some educated guesswork and arbitrary distinctions were necessarily involved)

- A more specific explanation of my sorting process: "Character Animation" denotes animation that involves characters, "Effects Animation" mostly designates animation that involves natural elements like water, fire, smoke, rain, etc, and "Mechanical Animation" generally means artificial props like trains, circus tents, etc. There is some overlap and borderline cases--for instance Cy Young's introductory storks are technically characters, but his role at Disney was traditionally always effects and they are treated more as effects than "personalities." (The delineation is even more fuzzy for "junior animators" who may start out working on minor effects or actions but may become full-fledged character animators down the line.) In some cases I am unfamiliar with the animators (e.g. Karl Van Leuven? Vernon Witt?) or their exact roles at Disney at the time (Russ Dyson?); when the draft lists multiple names on the same cut it does not distinguish their roles, therefore the placements of their names is my best guess.

- Aside from the animators, the rest of the credit categories are exactly as they appear in the film (with clarifications as needed), with the addition of Assistant Sequence Directors which went entirely uncredited.

- The animation directors both did key animation themselves and supervised particular characters, for instance Bill Tytla animated Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo while also supervising Bill Shull's additional scenes with them. It is less clear which animation director took precedence when they shared characters, given that both Woolie Reitherman and Fred Moore specialized in Timothy Mouse; though it seems likely they worked independently and corrected junior animators wherever they could given Dumbo's rushed production.

- "NC" means "not credited" in the film

Notable Artists

Bill Tytla - (Said to be "the greatest animator ever," lauded for his draftsmanship and "method acting" style of character animation, started at the Barré Studio and Terrytoons in New York, had extensive formal art training and studied painting and sculpture in Paris)

Art Babbitt - (Previously at Terrytoons in New York, known for his subtle and analytical character animation and his fierce protectiveness of his footage, also resident authority on animating Goofy, became a leader of the Disney animators' strike in the early 40s, later joined the UPA studio)

Fred Moore - (A "natural animation talent," probably the single artist most responsible for the Disney animation style, established the Disney concepts of "appeal" and "squash and stretch," responsible for the current design of Mickey Mouse)

Norm Ferguson - (Known for his highly influential personality animation of Mickey's dog Pluto, also known for his extremely rough style of drawing that required a veritable army of assistants to clean up, revolutionized Disney's character animation with his extensive flypaper sequence in 1934's "Playful Pluto")

Ward Kimball - (One of Disney's "nine old men," specialized in wild comedy characters, known for his brilliant and idiosyncratic posing, motion, and timing, lead animator on the crows in Dumbo, Jiminy Cricket, the Cheshire Cat, and the anarchic title song sequence in The Three Caballeros)

Woolie Reitherman - (One of Disney's "nine old men," proficient animating both broad comedy and highly technical action scenes, famously animated Monstro the Whale in Pinocchio, later became a director on every Disney animated feature from Sleeping Beauty (1959) to The Rescuers (1977))

John Lounsbery - (One of Disney's "nine old men," relatively lesser-known yet highly accomplished animator of broad comedy, lead animator on the crocodiles and hippos in Fantasia's Dance of the Hours)

Les Clark - (One of Disney's "nine old men" and the first of said group to join the studio, among the few employees to stick with Walt Disney when nearly the entire staff defected to Charles Mintz's studio in 1928, "resident Mickey expert" animator in the early 30s, tended to avoid the limelight yet routinely delivered versatile and high-caliber work such as his animation in tandem with Art Babbitt's in "The Country Cousin")

Bill Peet - (Widely regarded as Disney's best storyboard artist, responsible for the final model sheets of Dumbo's titular character, single-handedly storyboarded 101 Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone, later left Disney to become successful and beloved children's book author/illustrator)

Walt Kelly - (Created the famous comic strip "Pogo")

Ray Patterson - (Later mainstay animator on MGM's Tom & Jerry series)

Don Patterson - (Ray Patterson's brother, later director/ace animator on Woody Woodpecker at Walter Lantz's studio)

Howard Swift - (Animated most of the "Pink Elephants" sequence)

Maurice Noble - (Later became Chuck Jones's layout artist at Warner Bros, designing the famously stylized backgrounds in films like "Duck Dodgers of the 24½ century" and "What's Opera, Doc?")

John Hubley - (Later director at UPA and renowned independent animated filmmaker, responsible for such masterpieces as "Moonbird," "Rooty Toot Toot," and "The Tender Game")```
